## Netlify graph & NextJS starter for "near me" apps

After hearing about NextJS for oh, I don't know, years, I'm finally taking some time to get to work with it. In this project, I wanted to create a project skeleton for a variety of "find x near me" applications where a user could alter a base project to work with any of many APIs out there geared towards browsing nearby locations of x genre of place of interest. 

For my own project I'm going to demo it through two lenses, the first being: adoptable pets, and the second being parks within some distance from
the user. "Parks & Barks" as it were, so you can adopt a buddy and then find places to walk them.
